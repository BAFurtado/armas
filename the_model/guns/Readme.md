# Based on the Wolf-Sheep Predation Model

## Summary

A simple ecological model, consisting of three agent types: aggressors, victims, and police. 
TODO: Define whether police is a patch or a moving agent.
 
The aggressors and the victims wander around the grid at random. 

The model uses several Mesa concepts and features:
 - MultiGrid
 - Multiple agent types (wolves, sheep, grass)
 - Overlay arbitrary text (wolf's energy) on agent's shapes while drawing on CanvasGrid
 - Agents inheriting a behavior (random movement) from an abstract parent
 - Writing a model composed of multiple files.
 - Dynamically adding and removing agents from the schedule

## Installation

To install the dependencies use pip and the requirements.txt in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To run the model interactively, run ``mesa runserver`` in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ mesa runserver
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.

## Files

* ``guns/random_walker.py``: This defines the ``RandomWalker`` agent, which implements the behavior of moving randomly across a grid, one cell at a time. Both the Wolf and Sheep agents will inherit from it.
* ``guns/test_random_walk.py``: Defines a simple model and a text-only visualization intended to make sure the RandomWalk class was working as expected. This doesn't actually model anything, but serves as an ad-hoc unit test. To run it, ``cd`` into the ``guns`` directory and run ``python test_random_walk.py``. You'll see a series of ASCII grids, one per model step, with each cell showing a count of the number of agents in it.
* ``guns/agents.py``: Defines the Wolf, Sheep, and GrassPatch agent classes.
* ``guns/schedule.py``: Defines a custom variant on the RandomActivation scheduler, where all agents of one class are activated (in random order) before the next class goes -- e.g. all the wolves go, then all the sheep, then all the grass.
* ``guns/model.py``: Defines the Wolf-Sheep Predation model itself
* ``guns/server.py``: Sets up the interactive visualization server
* ``run.py``: Launches a model visualization server.
