#### Proposta inicial de análise dos efeitos da posse de armas de fogo em homicídios. 

"Traditionally, researchers have employed statistical methods to model crime. However, these approaches
are limited by being unable to model individual actions and behaviour. ... [a model should] attempt to model
the occurrence of crimes and motivations behind it. ... **explore the potential of the model to realistically
simulate the main processes and drivers within this system**." (Malleson, Heppenstall, See, 2009).  

We developed the model on top of [https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa] mesa wolf_sheep example
